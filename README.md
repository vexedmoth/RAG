# Basic LangChain RAG

> This RAG uses:

- [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) as the main library/framework
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as the engine to run AI models locally
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/chatinterface) as the web chat interface

Steps:

1. Run `store_in_vectorbd.py` to save information from the PDF into a local database
2. Run `init.py`
3. Open the browser on the corresponding port to interact `localhost:{puerto}`
